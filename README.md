# System Design using Tiva C launchpad

Small easy projects to play with some boards based on the ARM Cortex M 
microcontroller.
I am using two different development environments:
	Code Composer Studio and its driverlib library.
	Keil ÂµVision and CMSIS without any additional libraries.
The CCS and Keil projects won't be one two one equivalent.
